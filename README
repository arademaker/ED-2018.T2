#+TITLE: Algorithms and Data Structures @ EMAp/FGV

- instructor :: Alexandre Rademaker

the course is mostly based on DPV (see references below). Code will be
implemented in [[https://racket-lang.org][Racket]].

[[https://docs.racket-lang.org/getting-started/index.html][the Racket quickstart]]

following the Racket website advice in the link above, pick the
references you want to study from how confortable you are learning a
new programming language, and how much time you have to devote to it.

try to get up to speed with Racket in the first couple of weeks -- you
will probably be much busier later on.

if you already know a lisp language, check out this [[http://hyperpolyglot.org/lisp][sheet]].
