#+TITLE: exercise conventions
- each exercise has its own directory.

- an exercise stub is provided under a Racket file with the same name
  as the directory. 
  - you are expected to provide the functions listed in the =provide=
    form following their specifications.
  - any further details will be included in the racket file as
    comments.

- your solution should be a file named after your github handle in the
  appropriate directory.

- there is also a =tests.rkt= file with preliminary tests you can run
  to check your implementation. you are encouraged to write your own
  tests too, as these will not be the only tests run on your solution.

- do not add any other files or deviate from these conventions unless
  explicitly asked to do so.

if you have any doubts, check the =linked-list= directory for an
example of how it works.
